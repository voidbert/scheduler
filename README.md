# Scheduler

A schedule generator for UMinho's Software Engineering course, based on integer programming.

# Setup

Start by cloning this repository, and then create a Python virtual environment:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/voidbert/scheduler.git
$ python -m venv .venv
```

To run the project, do:

```
$ source .venv/bin/activate
$ pip install --editable .
$ scheduler
```

To exit the virtual environment, you can run:

```
$ deactivate
```

# Development

To setup the development environment, inside the virtual environment, start by installing the
development packages:

```
$ pip install --editable .[dev]
```

The application can be tested with `pytest`, and coverage reports can be generated by `coverage`:

```
$ coverage run && coverage html
```

The code can also be type-checked with `mypy`. Type annotations are mandatory (`strict` mode is
used).

```
$ mypy
```
